This is set up for C# programming.

Hopefully I can set it up to switch between mac and PC controls easily.

Most common characters:
 = { } x y 0 1 i

```
[space] etniosar [tab] pdhcl.mfu;g)(y-=bxv/w{}[],+"021j<k>:q!z*&_?'|36#45879%
```

this if new null int var return public private

231x this
200x =
112x {
112x }
 70x int
 65x x
 63x y
 56x //
 55x 0
 50x 1
 37x return
 36x if
 33x public
 29x private


so this is the new keyboard layout where i moved the keys to the center of the key pads. it is kinda weird, but possibly worth trying for a while to see if i get used to it. it does require some concentration to use, especially in that if my hand position changes at all it can be difficult to find my way back to the home row. 
the advantage that this gives me is a few more keys on either hand to play with.
the inside control rows are the ones that can be used for newer effects like dedicated backspace or brackets.
the brackets one could be pretty cool for making code typing faster. 
/this is actually 

backspace and undo/redo are frequently used.
can have the arrow keys on hjkl using modifiers
double tap ; to send ; and return
hijack number line and just have upper turn the right hand into a numpad
adjust layer can be used for switching pc to mac mode
characters = { } need dedicated keys
double tap { or } should add a return
